# A Deep Reinforcement learning AI bot for the game of Tetris

This project was done thanks to the amazing [PyBoy open-source GameBoy Emulator](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy) which gave me access to an user friendly API and helped me avoid the headache of creating my own game of tetris, while also giving me access to some handy features such as the game score, the line counts and a representation of the game area.
